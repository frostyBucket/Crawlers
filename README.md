CRAWLERS!!

This repository is meant to be a sort of demo of my web crawling abilities, so there's going to be a couple scrapers in here, written pretty much entirely with either Python or Java depending on what I feel like writing in that day.

eBay Scraper
	A quick scraper that I built in Java using Jsoup, it runs the scrape and then you'd run my Excel Handler (all Excel stuff is handled in Python regardless of project language). Someday soon I will have the Excel Handler run automatically because efficiency matters.

*Note: NONE of my work is done with malicious intent this is all done for demoing purposes!
